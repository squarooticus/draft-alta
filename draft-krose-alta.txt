                Asymmetric Loss-Tolerant Authentication
                        draft-krose-alta-latest

Abstract

   Establishing authenticity of a stream of datagrams in the presence of
   multiple receivers is naively achieved through the use of asymmetric
   digital signatures, but at high computational cost.  Timed Efficient
   Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) instead employs
   relatively cheap symmetric authentication, achieving asymmetry via
   time-delayed key disclosure, adding latency to verification and
   imposing requirements on time synchronization between receivers and
   the sender to prevent forgery.  This document introduces Asymmetric
   Loss-Tolerant Authentication (ALTA), which employs an acyclic graph
   of message authentication codes (MACs) transmitted alongside data
   payloads, with redundancy to enable authentication of all received
   payloads in the presence of certain patterns of loss, along with
   regularly paced digital signatures.  ALTA requires no time
   synchronization and enables authentication of payloads as soon as
   sufficient authentication material has been received.

1.  Introduction

   Authenticity of a stream of data may be inexpensively established via
   symmetric message authentication codes (MACs) using keys pre-shared
   exclusively between two parties, as the receiver knows it did not
   originate the data and that only one other party has access to the
   key.  In the presence of multiple receivers, however, this is not
   possible because all receivers must have access to the same key,
   giving any one of them the ability to forge messages.

   Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) [RFC4082]
   solves this problem by delaying the release of keying material to a
   deadline at which any packets protected by said key that are
   subsequently received must be discarded by a receiver.  While this
   reintroduces asymmetry between sender and receiver, it requires the
   sender and each receiver to (loosely) synchronize clocks and imposes
   authentication latency relative to RTT and to a pre-declared upper
   bound on skew.

   Clock synchronization is not as trivial as it appears: internet-
   connected hosts often have significant clock skew relative to stratum

   0 NTP servers [timeskew], and anyway enterprises serving valuable
   assets do not regard NTP as a reliable interdomain security protocol.
   Together with the need to avoid attacks that delay packets required
   for synchronization, this implies the need for an interactive unicast
   authenticated clock synchronization protocol, which is complicated by
   the need to maintain clock synchronization across both the stream
   publisher and multiple geographically-distributed nodes in a content
   delivery network (CDN).

   This document introduces Asymmetric Loss-Tolerant Authentication
   (ALTA), which eschews time synchronization for a direct application
   of digital signatures to an acyclic graph of message authentication
   codes with redundancy sufficient to tolerate certain patterns of
   loss.  This algorithm is based on research by Golle and Modadugu
   published in [STRAUTH].
