                Asymmetric Loss-Tolerant Authentication
                        draft-krose-alta-latest

Abstract

   Establishing authenticity of a stream of datagrams in the presence of
   multiple receivers is naively achieved through the use of asymmetric
   digital signatures, but at high computational cost.  Timed Efficient
   Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) instead employs
   relatively cheap symmetric authentication, achieving asymmetry via
   time-delayed key disclosure, adding latency to verification and
   imposing requirements on time synchronization between clients and the
   publisher to prevent injection.  This document introduces Asymmetric
   Loss-Tolerant Authentication (ALTA), which employs a graph of message
   authentication codes (MACs) transmitted alongside data payloads, with
   redundancy to enable authentication of all received payloads in the
   presence of certain patterns of loss, along with regularly paced
   digital signatures.  ALTA requires no time synchronization and
   enables authentication of payloads as soon as sufficient
   authentication material has been received.

Acknowledgments

   The author wishes to acknowledge the contributions of his colleague,
   Jake Holland, whose work with interdomain multicast live video
   delivery drove the need for a robust solution to the streaming
   authentication problem, and Eric Rescorla, who introduced the author
   to the paper describing the loss-tolerant symmetric authentication
   scheme used as the basis for ALTA.
